The content sample appears to be from various pages of the Purti Realty website, including sections like About Us, Community, Careers, Legacy, Awards, Invest With Us, NRI Purti Privilege, and pages potentially showcasing projects.

Here's the analysis for each keyword:

There's a dedicated section titled ""Buy Luxurious Flats & Villas in Kolkata"" which lists several residential projects.
        *   ""Best"" is strongly implied and directly claimed through titles like ""Best Real Estate Company in Kolkata"", ""Most Popular Real estate Company in Kolkata"", and the numerous awards listed, many specifically for residential projects (""Villa Project Of The Year"", ""Residential Complex Of The Year"", etc.).

2.  **best retail properties by purti realty kolkata:**

        *   ""Best"" is implied by the overall claim of being a top/popular real estate company and the listing of awards (even if not specific *retail* property awards in this excerpt, general company accolades suggest quality across segments).

        *   ""NRI"" is a major focus. There's an ""NRI PURTI PRIVILEGE"" menu option and a large dedicated section titled ""nri - Purti"" which explicitly discusses ""Invest In Indian Real Estate"", regulations for NRIs buying property, payment methods, repatriation, and offers ""Hassle-free property buying backed by expert guidance"".

5.  **invest in real estate projects kolkata purti:**

        *   The ""INVEST WITH US"" section details ways to invest (Property Development, Joint Venture, etc.).
        *   Specific ""real estate projects"" (both residential and implied retail/office) are mentioned and listed, with locations like Kolkata mentioned.

        *   While the NRI section itself doesn't repeat ""in Kolkata"" constantly, the site's overall focus (titles like ""Best Real Estate Company in Kolkata"", project listings in Kolkata) makes it clear that the NRI services apply to their properties in Kolkata.

7.  **purti realty services for nri property investment:**
    *   **Relevance:** **High**.
    *   **Justification:**
        *   ""Purti Realty"" is the company.
        *   ""Services for NRI property investment"" is almost a direct description of the content in the ""nri - Purti"" section. This section details the process for NRIs, addresses regulations, payment, etc., providing the ""expert guidance and compliance"" that constitutes the ""services"". It's clearly aimed at facilitating property investment for NRIs.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the content provided, all the listed keywords show a **High** level of relevance. The content explicitly mentions or strongly implies all the key components of these keywords, covering residential, retail, build-to-suit, investment, NRI-specific information, the location (Kolkata/India), and the company name (Purti Realty).

1,"buy retail shop in burrabazar kolkata, find ready retail shops shyambazar",0.0006941637115425289,0.9695996691999675,"Based on the provided content sample and the keywords:

*   **Keywords:** buy retail shop in burrabazar kolkata, find ready retail shops shyambazar
*   **Content Sample:** Various pages/sections about Purti Realty, a real estate company in Kolkata, covering About Us, Careers, Legacy, Awards, Invest With Us, NRI, Community, and specific project types (Homes, Office, Retail).

**Relevance Analysis:**

1.  **Relevance to ""Real Estate Company in Kolkata"":** **High.** The content clearly identifies Purti Realty as a major real estate developer in Kolkata, operating for many years, winning awards, and involved in various projects in the city (Hastings, Rajarhat, Maheshtala, Lake Town, Ballygunge).
2.  **Relevance to ""Retail Shops"" / ""Commercial Property"":** **Moderate to High.** The content explicitly mentions ""Retail"" multiple times. The navigation includes ""Find Your Space Retail"" and ""Purti Retail"". The ""Our Brands"" section highlights ""A Promising Retail Experience"". The MD's desk section states that Purti Realty has earned market trust in ""retail, and residential real estate"". Ankit Agarwal's profile mentions an entrepreneurial stint with a ""pure-play retail setup"". The ""Invest With Us"" section mentions ""commercial spaces"" in Kolkata as an investment opportunity. While ""shop"" isn't explicitly used, ""retail"" strongly implies commercial shop spaces.
3.  **Relevance to ""buy"" / ""find"" / ""ready"":** **Moderate.** The content is from a developer's site, implying properties are for sale (""buy""). The navigation uses ""Find Your Homes"", ""Find Your Office"", ""Find Your Space Retail"", addressing the ""find"" intent. The ""Purti Homes"" section mentions ""Ready to move-in"" projects, which aligns with the ""ready"" aspect, although this is shown for residential, not specifically retail, projects in the sample. The NRI section mentions ""Hassle-free property buying"".
4.  **Relevance to Specific Locations (""burrabazar kolkata"", ""shyambazar""):** **None.** The provided content sample *does not* mention ""Burrabazar"" or ""Shyambazar"" at all. It lists other Kolkata localities where Purti has projects, but these specific areas are absent.

**Conclusion on Keyword Relevance:**

The content is **partially relevant** to the keywords.

*   It aligns with the core topic of finding/buying retail/commercial property in Kolkata from a reputable developer.
*   However, it completely **lacks specificity regarding the crucial location components** (""Burrabazar"" and ""Shyambazar"").

For users searching for retail shops *specifically* in Burrabazar or Shyambazar, this page is unlikely to directly address their need because it doesn't mention properties in those precise areas. A website page highly relevant to these keywords would need to showcase specific retail properties available for purchase in Burrabazar and Shyambazar.

This content is more generic, introducing the company and its range of services/projects in Kolkata overall, including retail spaces, but without the detailed, location-specific inventory required to match these particular long-tail keywords effectively."
2,ready to move apartments in maheshtala,0.0006995450093024238,2.6326662386980115,"Based on the provided content sample, here is an analysis of its relevance to the keywords ""ready to move apartments in maheshtala"":

1.  **Relevance to ""Maheshtala"":**
    *   **High Relevance:** The location ""Maheshtala"" is explicitly mentioned multiple times in the content.
        *   It is listed as the location of one of Purti Realty's schools (""Narayana School in Maheshtala"").
        *   It is mentioned as the location of Purti Realty's first high-rise project in 2008.
        *   Crucially, it is listed as the location of a specific project under the ""Featured Projects"" section: ""Ready to move-in **Maheshtala**, Kolkata"".

2.  **Relevance to ""apartments"":**
    *   **Good Relevance (using synonyms/related terms):** While the exact word ""apartments"" is not used frequently, the content is clearly focused on residential real estate. It uses synonyms and related terms such as:
        *   ""Homes"" (e.g., ""Find Your Homes"", ""Purti Homes"", ""building their homes"").
        *   ""Flats"" (e.g., ""Buy Luxurious Flats & Villas in Kolkata"").
        *   ""residential property"" / ""residential real estate"" / ""residential projects"".
        *   The ""Ready to move-in Maheshtala"" listing appears under the ""Buy Luxurious Flats & Villas"" and ""Purti Homes"" sections, strongly implying that the offering is residential units like flats or apartments.

3.  **Relevance to ""ready to move"":**
    *   **High Relevance:** The phrase ""Ready to move-in"" is explicitly used in the content.
        *   Specifically, the listing for the project in Maheshtala is tagged as ""Ready to move-in"". This directly matches the ""ready to move"" part of the keyword phrase.
        *   Customer testimonials also mention timely possession, which supports the idea of delivering projects ready for occupancy.

**Overall Relevance Score:** High

**Analysis Summary:**

The provided content is highly relevant to the keyword phrase ""ready to move apartments in maheshtala"".

*   It explicitly names ""Maheshtala"" as a location where Purti Realty has developed projects, including their first high-rise and, most importantly, a currently listed ""Ready to move-in"" project.

3,"buy office space in hastings kolkata, find office space kolkata purti",0.0007943331288547578,1.1796552013227297,"Okay, let's analyze the relevance of the keywords to the provided content sample.

**Keywords:**
1.  `buy office space in hastings kolkata`
2.  `find office space kolkata purti`

**Content Analysis:**

1.  **Brand Mention (`Purti`, `Purti Realty`):** The content mentions ""Purti"" and ""Purti Realty"" extensively throughout, as it is the company's website content. This is highly relevant to the `purti` part of the second keyword.
2.  **Location Mention (`Kolkata`):** ""Kolkata"" is mentioned frequently, often in the context of the company's location and projects (e.g., ""Best Real Estate Company in Kolkata"", ""Hastings, Kolkata"", ""Rajarhat, Kolkata"", etc.). This is highly relevant to the `kolkata` part of both keywords.
3.  **Location Mention (`Hastings`):** ""Hastings"" is mentioned several times.
    *   In navigation links (`Purti Flowers Hastings`, `Office Hasting Office Corporate`).
    *   In project mentions: `Residential Project - High End - The Economic Times Real Estate Awards 2024 (National Edition) Hastings, Kolkata Starting from 2.68 Cr`. This explicitly mentions a project called ""Purti Hastings"" located in Hastings, Kolkata.
4.  **Property Type Mention (`office space`, `office`):**
    *   The term ""office"" appears in navigation links (`Office Hasting Office Corporate`, `Find Your Homes Office`, `Purti Office`).
    *   The broader category of commercial/retail space is mentioned (`Find Your Space Retail`, `A Promising Retail Experience`).
    *   Under ""Invest With Us"", ""Property Development"" and ""Development Management"" are mentioned, which *could* include office space, but it's not specified.
    *   The project list focuses heavily on ""Purti Homes"" (residential), ""Retail"", ""Hospitality"", and includes ""Hastings, Kolkata"" listed *specifically* under ""Residential Project"".
5.  **Action/Intent Mention (`buy`, `find`):**
    *   ""buy"" is not explicitly used in terms of ""buy office space"". However, the overall context of a ""Real Estate Company"", ""INVEST WITH US"", and project listings implies buying/investing.
    *   ""find"" is used in navigation (`Find Your Homes`, `Find Your Homes Office`, `Find Your Space Retail`).

**Relevance Assessment:**

1.  **Keyword: `buy office space in hastings kolkata`**
    *   The content mentions ""Purti"" (the company operating), ""Kolkata"", and ""Hastings"". It even mentions a project called ""Purti Hastings"" in Kolkata.
    *   It mentions ""office"" as a category Purti deals with (via navigation links like ""Purti Office"", ""Find Your Homes Office"").
    *   **However, the content explicitly lists ""Hastings, Kolkata"" under ""Residential Project"".** There is no clear mention or listing of *office space* specifically located *in Hastings* that is available for purchase. The navigation link ""Office Hasting"" exists, but the detailed content does not support it being an active office project for sale/rent.
    *   **Relevance:** Moderate but potentially misleading. While many individual terms are present, the crucial combination of ""office space"" + ""Hastings"" + ""buy"" is *not* directly and clearly addressed. A user searching this would likely find the ""Purti Hastings"" residential project info, but not office space details.

2.  **Keyword: `find office space kolkata purti`**
    *   The content mentions ""Purti"", ""Kolkata"", and ""office"" (via navigation links like ""Purti Office"", ""Find Your Homes Office""). It indicates Purti Realty operates in Kolkata and deals with office spaces.
    *   The term ""find"" is used in navigation, aligning with the user's intent.
    *   **However, similar to the first keyword, the content lacks specific listings or details about *available* office spaces in Kolkata.** It confirms the company's overall offering includes office space but doesn't function as a directory or detail page for current office projects.
    *   **Relevance:** Moderate. It confirms that Purti Realty is a real estate company in Kolkata that offers office spaces, but it doesn't provide the specific information (listings, descriptions, etc.) a user would need to *find* or evaluate office space options. The content is more about the company's profile than specific property inventory for this category.

**Conclusion:**

The content is **partially relevant** to both keywords.

*   It successfully includes the brand (`Purti`) and the main location (`Kolkata`).
*   It mentions the specific location (`Hastings`) but links it to a *residential* project, not an office one in the primary content.
*   It mentions `office` as a category but does not provide specific details, listings, or project information about available office spaces in Kolkata or Hastings.

For better relevance and search performance for these keywords, the website content would ideally need:

*   A dedicated section or page detailing Purti's office projects in Kolkata.
*   Clear information on whether office spaces are available for ""buy"" or ""rent"".
*   Specific listings or descriptions of office properties, including details like location (explicitly mentioning Hastings if applicable), size, price/rent, and features.
*   If ""Purti Hastings"" is purely residential, the site should be careful not to imply it has office space (unless the ""Office Hasting"" navigation refers to a different, unlisted project)."
4,vaastu compliant homes in kolkata purti,0.0007915766793757244,1.1746886866915538,"Based on the provided content sample and the keyword phrase ""vaastu compliant homes in kolkata purti"", here is an analysis of the relevance:

1.  **""Purti""**: The content is highly relevant to this part of the keyword. The entire sample is about ""Purti Realty"" and its activities. The name ""Purti"" appears numerous times throughout the text.

2.  **""Kolkata""**: The content is highly relevant to this part of the keyword. The text explicitly mentions ""Kolkata"" multiple times as the location where Purti Realty operates and has projects. Phrases like ""Best Real Estate Company in Kolkata"", mentions of specific Kolkata locations/projects (Hastings, Rajarhat, Maheshtala, Lake Town, Ballygunge), and references to the ""city of Kolkata"" are present.

3.  **""homes""**: The content is highly relevant to this part of the keyword. The text discusses ""homes"", ""residential real estate"", ""residential projects"", ""flats"", and ""villas"". Purti Realty is presented as a builder of homes.

4.  **""vaastu compliant""**: The content is **not relevant** to this crucial part of the keyword. A thorough scan of the provided text sample reveals **no mention** of ""vaastu"", ""vastu"", ""vaastu compliant"", or any related terms or concepts pertaining to traditional Indian architectural principles.

**Overall Relevance Assessment:**

The content is highly relevant to *Purti Realty's residential properties in Kolkata*. However, it completely lacks any information regarding *vaastu compliance*.

For the specific keyword phrase ""vaastu compliant homes in kolkata purti"", the content is **partially relevant but significantly lacking**. The missing ""vaastu compliant"" element is a key qualifier in the user's search intent. A user searching for this phrase is specifically looking for properties that adhere to Vastu Shastra principles, and this content does not address that specific requirement at all.

This page would likely rank for broader terms like ""Purti homes Kolkata"" or ""Purti Realty Kolkata"", but it is highly unlikely to rank well or satisfy the user's intent for the specific, qualified search ""vaastu compliant homes in kolkata purti""."
5,luxury villas near durgapur expressway purti,0.0009425522703583615,0.4029920902551533,"Based on the content sample provided and the keyword ""luxury villas near durgapur expressway purti"", here's an analysis of the relevance:

1.  **Purti:** The content is *highly* relevant to ""Purti"". The company name ""Purti Realty"" and ""Purti Group"" appears numerous times throughout the text. This element of the keyword is perfectly matched.

2.  **Luxury Villas:** The content is relevant to ""luxury villas"":
    *   The page titled ""Buy Luxurious Flats & Villas in Kolkata"" explicitly mentions ""Luxurious Flats & Villas"".
    *   The Awards section lists multiple awards for ""Villa Project Of The Year"" and specifically ""Luxury Villa Project Of The Year (East) – Meraki"".
    *   The ""About Us"" section mentions the group's entry into ""luxury real estate with Meraki Samsara"".
    *   One of the featured projects is titled ""Samsara, Durgapur Expressway"" and is described as a ""Second Home Project Of The Year – Meraki"" and ""Residential Project (Villas) – Meraki"" in the awards section. The price point (""Starting from 4.16 Cr"") also suggests a luxury offering.

3.  **Near Durgapur Expressway:** The content is *highly* relevant to ""near durgapur expressway"":
    *   One of the listed featured projects is ""Samsara, Durgapur Expressway"". Listing a project *at* ""Durgapur Expressway"" directly addresses the geographical component of the search query, strongly implying it is either on or very near the expressway.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content is **highly relevant** to the keyword phrase ""luxury villas near durgapur expressway purti"".

*   It clearly identifies ""Purti"" as the developer.
*   It mentions ""luxury"" properties and specifically ""villas"" as offerings.
*   It explicitly lists a specific project called ""Samsara"" which is identified as a ""Luxury Villa Project"" (via awards and description of ""Meraki Samsara"") and is located *at* ""Durgapur Expressway"".

The content directly answers the user's likely intent: finding luxury villas developed by Purti located near the Durgapur Expressway."

3.  **Under Construction:** The status ""Under Construction"" is also explicitly associated with the ""Lake Town, Jessore Road"" project in the ""Featured Projects"" section.
4.  **Flats:** While the term ""flats"" appears in the overall heading ""Buy Luxurious Flats & Villas in Kolkata - 3, 4 & 5 BHK"", the projects listed are described as ""Homes"" or fall under the ""Purti Homes"" brand. The mention of ""3, 4 & 5 BHK"" clearly indicates residential units, which are commonly referred to as flats or apartments. The context strongly implies residential properties like flats.

**Conclusion:**

The content directly addresses the user's query by featuring a specific Purti Realty project located in Lake Town that is explicitly stated as being ""Under Construction"" and offering residential units (implied as flats/homes through context like ""Purti Homes"" and ""3, 4 & 5 BHK"").

More importantly, under the ""Invest With Us"" section, there is a specific heading for ""Warehouse"" where they state, ""Integrating innovative approaches with our unwavering commitment to excellence, we specialise in building warehouses within industrial spaces.""

4.  **""Management"":** Relevant, specifically in the context of ""Development Management"". The content lists ""Development Management"" as a service under ""Invest With Us"". While this is general project management, it applies to managing development projects, which could include warehouses.

5.  **Combination ""warehouse development management kolkata"":** This is where the relevance is most direct and notable.
    *   The **exact phrase ""Warehouse Development Management""** appears as a distinct list item or header within the ""Invest With Us"" section. This is a strong indicator of direct relevance for this specific service combination.
    *   The location **""Kolkata""** is consistently associated with the company's real estate activities, including implicitly the ""warehousing business"" and the building of ""warehouses within industrial spaces"" which would be within their service area (Kolkata and East India, as mentioned).

*   Crucially, the specific phrase **""Warehouse Development Management""** is *present* in the content, indicating that this is a service offered.

While the *detailed descriptions* under the ""Warehouse"" and ""Development Management"" sections are somewhat brief and generic, the explicit mention of the compound phrase ""Warehouse Development Management"" and the presence of all individual components (""warehouse"", ""development"", ""management"", ""kolkata"") within the content make it relevant to this specific search query. A user searching for this term would find relevant information about the company's location and its services that directly align with the keywords, particularly within the ""Invest With Us"" section."

12,find 2bhk apartments in kolkata purti,0.0007265783513955574,1.32981418998205,"Okay, let's analyze the relevance of the provided content sample to the keyword phrase ""find 2bhk apartments in kolkata purti"".

We'll break down the keyword and see how well the content matches each component:

1.  **""purti""**: The content is **highly relevant** to ""Purti"". It is the official website content for ""Purti Realty"" and mentions the brand name extensively throughout the text, navigation, section headers, and project names (Purti Flowers, Purti Aroma, The Varanda, Purti Veda, Purti Iris, Purti Aqua, Purti Jewel, Purti Planet, Purti Hastings).

2.  **""kolkata""**: The content is **highly relevant** to ""Kolkata"". It explicitly states ""Best Real Estate Company in Kolkata - Purti Realty"", mentions ""Kolkata"" multiple times in various contexts (location of projects, jobs, the city itself as a growing metro), and lists projects with locations clearly within or near Kolkata (E.M. Bypass, Bondel Road Ballygunge, Lake Town Jessore Road, Rajarhat Kolkata, Hastings Kolkata, Maheshtala Kolkata).

3.  **""apartments"" / ""homes""**: The content is **relevant** to ""apartments"" or ""homes"". It talks about ""Find Your Homes"", ""building their homes"", ""residential real estate"", ""Purti Homes"", ""Flats"", and mentions ""apartment"" in customer testimonials.

4.  **""2bhk""**: This is the **critical missing element**. The content *does not* mention ""2BHK"" anywhere. It lists project types (""Flats & Villas"") and *specifically* mentions other sizes: ""3, 4 & 5 BHK"" in a prominent header. It lists individual projects with starting prices but does not specify the unit sizes available within those projects in this sample, except for explicitly mentioning 3, 4, and 5 BHK in the header.

**Conclusion on Relevance:**

The content is **partially relevant** to the keyword phrase ""find 2bhk apartments in kolkata purti"".

*   It is strongly relevant to the brand (""Purti"") and the location (""Kolkata"").
*   It is relevant to the type of property (""apartments"" / ""homes"").
*   **However, it completely fails to address the specific size requirement (""2BHK"").** In fact, the content explicitly highlights 3, 4, and 5 BHK options, suggesting that 2BHK might not be the focus of the properties featured on this *specific page* or in the prominent project listings provided in the sample.

Therefore, while a user searching for this keyword might land on this page (as it contains ""Purti"" and ""Kolkata""), the page content itself does not directly provide information about 2BHK apartments, making its relevance for *that specific user intent* low. To be highly relevant, the content would need to list or describe 2BHK units available from Purti in Kolkata."
